# Database Indexes: What They Are and How They Work

## What are Database Indexes?

A database index is a special data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table. Think of it like the index at the back of a book. Instead of reading the entire book page by page to find a topic (a "**full table scan**"), you can look it up in the index and go directly to the correct page.

The main purpose of an index is to make your `SELECT` queries with `WHERE` clauses significantly faster.

## How do Database Indexes Work?

The performance difference comes from how the database finds your data.

* **Without an Index (Full Table Scan üê¢):** The database has no information about where a specific piece of data lives. It must start at the first row, check it, move to the second row, check it, and so on, until it has examined every single row in the table. For large tables, this is very slow.

* **With an Index (Index Seek üöÄ):** When you create an index on a column (e.g., `email`), the database builds a separate, sorted data structure called a **B-Tree**. This structure stores the indexed column's values and a direct pointer to the original data row. When you search for a user by email, the database can now navigate this sorted tree to find the exact location of the data in just a few steps, avoiding a full scan.

This efficiency comes with a trade-off:
* **Faster Reads:** Queries that filter on indexed columns are dramatically faster.
* **Slower Writes:** `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations become slightly slower because the database must update both the table and the index structure.
* **More Storage:** The index itself takes up extra disk space.

## A Deeper Look: The B-Tree & Time Complexity

The magic of an index lies in its **B-Tree** structure and the dramatic impact it has on search time complexity.

To see this in action, experiment with the interactive B-Tree visualization on [PlanetScale's blog](https://planetscale.com/blog/btrees-and-database-indexes).

After creating a tree, compare the number of steps it takes to find a specific value using two different methods:
- Linear Scan: Checking every value one-by-one in the order they have been inserted.
- Tree Traversal: Following the branches from the root node down to the target value.

A B-Tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that keeps data sorted and is optimized for systems that read and write large blocks of data, like a database. When used for a database index it has a few key components:
* **Root Node:** The single entry point at the very top of the tree.
* **Internal Nodes:** These are like signposts. They don't hold the final data but contain key ranges that guide the search down to the correct branch.
* **Leaf Nodes:** The bottom level of the tree. The leaves contain the sorted index values (e.g., `user500@example.com`) and a pointer to the full data row on disk. A crucial feature is that all leaf nodes are at the same depth.

This structure changes the efficiency of a search:
* **Full Table Scan (No Index):** The time it takes to find an item is directly proportional to the number of rows ($N$) in the table. This is a linear time complexity of **$O(N)$**. To find 1 row in 1 million, you may have to do 1 million checks in the worst case.
* **Index Seek (B-Tree):** By jumping from the root to internal nodes to a leaf, the search eliminates huge portions of the data at each step. This results in a logarithmic time complexity of **$O(\log N)$**. For 1 million rows, an $O(\log N)$ search might only take 20 steps. This is why the indexed search in our simulation is a lot faster.

The B-Tree for our example program will look similar to this diagram:

## Simulation

### How To

1.  Clone this repo.

2.  Increase values in lines 20 and 21 in `Main.kt` by multiples of 10:
    ```kotlin
    val userCount = 1_000                       // <- manipulate for simulation: first to 10_000, second to 100_000, etc.
    val targetEmail = "user500@example.com"     // <- manipulate for simulation: first to "user5000@example.com", second to "user50000@example.com", etc.
    ```

3.  Run the `main` function.

4.  Report the numbers to the group.

5.  Repeat for all value pairs in below Results Table.

### Results

| Number of Users | Find User | Times without index (in ms) | Time with index (in ms) | Average time (in ms) |
| :-------------- | :-------- | :-------------------------- | :---------------------- | :------------------- |
| 1,000           | 500       | ...                         | ...                     | ...                  |
| 10,000          | 5,000     | ...                         | ...                     | ...                  |
| 100,000         | 50,000    | ...                         | ...                     | ...                  |
| 1,000,000       | 500,000   | ...                         | ...                     | ...                  |
| 10,000,000      | 5,000,000 | ...                         | ...                     | ...                  |
